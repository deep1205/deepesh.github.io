  My schooling was done in an mpboard school.Literally speaking,there were only painting in computer lab.So Obvbiously no scope of even html,what to speak of programming they were
            out of scope then.But here in IIT,I started learning some programming when i got to realize these are also important and really cool.Right now,i am practicing codes on online
            websites.For the websites,I learned HTML,CSS,bootstrap.This website is the implementation of what i have learned.HOPEFULLY you will like it.
